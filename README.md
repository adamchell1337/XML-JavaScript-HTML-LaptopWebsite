# XML-JavaScript-HTML-LaptopWebsite
This website was designed for part of my module coursework. The brief was to create a website that sells electronic goods, and to have various pages that show off different web development skills. Although it may appear that the site does not actually function as a whole, this is intended as the second part of the coursework is to adapt this site using PHP & SQL to allow users to login, create baskets, checkout etc. 
### Some Features:
- Responsive design: Adapts to mobile and tablet devices using CSS media queries.
- XML Products: The products page uses a JavaScript loop to fetch all data on the laptops which are stored in the XML file to then place them into formatted div tags.
- Validated Form: The Login/Register pages use JavaScript to validate the data being entered into the forms and ensures that the terms and conditions are being agreed to etc.
- Offers Slider: The slider to show off latest promotions has been developed in JavaScript to be interactive for the user.
### Please see the report.html for further information on the design of the site.
